#Chunks of MySQL that can be helpful. DO NOT RUN!


#This is a quick and dirty way of clearing a table. NB: DOES NOT WORK with foreign keys

TRUNCATE TABLE <$table>;


#This turns off "safe updates", drops every piece of information in a table, resets the auto_increment, then turns "safe updates" back on.
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
DELETE FROM <$table>;
ALTER TABLE <$table> AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
